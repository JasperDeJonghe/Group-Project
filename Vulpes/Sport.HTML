                    I have always loved running, from a young age I loved being active and playing sports. Though as a result of covid-19 and academic stress I wasn't always able to do that thing a loved. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Thats why I got into running, besides the fact that I want to train my endurance and physical health I also love to clear my mind and just focusing on the road ahead.

                    I started playing hockey around 10 years ago, at the time I was just looking for any sport to play because my parents wanted me to play a sport. But even after my parents didn't force me to play a sport I continued playing hockey because I just loved the game.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The reason I love the sport is pretty simple, it doesn't revolve around brute force. I have never been the fastest or strongest in my team, but with hockey that doesn't that doesn't really matter you can still win by being technical and tactical.

                     I got into sailing because of my sister, she joined a school camp where you went sailing for a week to get to know the sport, and she loved it. So in the holiday after me and my family went sailing. I fell in love with the sport as well.
                    <br>   
                    <br>
                    Since I got the know the sport I wanted to get better in it, so I went on the same school camp and achieved all 4 obtainable certificates, I also earned 3/4 official CWO (Water Sports Training Committee) diplomas for sailing.
